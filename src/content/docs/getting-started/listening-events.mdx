## Updating seyfert config

Before starting this chapter we shall update `seyfert.config.mjs` in order to tell seyfert where our events file will be.

```ts {11} title="seyfert.config.mjs" showLineNumbers
// @ts-check
import { config } from "seyfert";

export default config.bot({
  token: process.env.BOT_TOKEN ?? "",
  intents: ["Guilds"],
  locations: {
    base: "src",
    output: "dist",
    commands: "commands",
    events: "events" // - src/events will be our events directory
  }
});
```

## Listening Event

Each event file shall export by default the `createEvent` function so seyfert is able to load them

Let's listen the `botReady` event as first example

```ts title="src/events/botReady.ts" showLineNumbers
import { createEvent } from "seyfert";

export default createEvent({
  // botReady executes when all shards and guilds are ready.
  data: { once: true, name: "botReady" },
  run(user, client) {
    client.logger.info(`${user.username} is ready`);
  }
})
```


Let's check another example with `guildDelete` event:

```ts title="src/events/guildDelete.ts" showLineNumbers
import { createEvent } from "seyfert";

export default createEvent({
  data: { name: "guildDelete" },
  run(unguild, client) {
    // it's possible that the guild has been deleted.
    if (unguild.unavailable) return;
    client.logger.info(`I have been kicked out of: ${unguild.id}`);
  }
})
```

Below is the current file tree of the project if you did follow the previous steps.
