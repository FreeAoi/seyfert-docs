## Setting up prefixes

Not only does seyfert handle application commands but also `prefix commands`. They are not enabled by default but you can enable them by setting up an option inside the [`ClientOptions`](https://github.com/tiramisulabs/seyfert/blob/455ed12b0ebcb3ddf55bc8b3274b0ce904becc62/src/client/client.ts#L230). We have to access to the `command` option where we can specify a suboption called `prefix`. This option expects a callback returning an array of possible prefixes for that command. As the callback returns a [`Message`](https://github.com/tiramisulabs/seyfert/blob/455ed12b0ebcb3ddf55bc8b3274b0ce904becc62/src/structures/Message.ts#L123) is pretty simple to handle diffrent prefixes per guild.

Here is an example in which we are going to set multiple prefixes for all the commands.

```ts showLineNumbers copy ins={4-9} wrap

import { Client } from 'seyfert';

const client = new Client({
    commands: {
        prefix: (msg) => {
            //here you can handle whatever prefixes you will want to be consider depending on the message data.
            return ['!', '?', '.']
        }
    }
});

```


## Handling prefix commands

Having set up our prefixes for the commands it's about time we want to make them run.

And for your luck, the handling works as application commands. The only difference is that we receive an optional [`Message`](https://github.com/tiramisulabs/seyfert/blob/455ed12b0ebcb3ddf55bc8b3274b0ce904becc62/src/structures/Message.ts#L123) property inside [`CommandContext`](https://github.com/tiramisulabs/seyfert/blob/455ed12b0ebcb3ddf55bc8b3274b0ce904becc62/src/commands/applications/chatcontext.ts#L24).

To make this property appear in our CommandContext the only thing we shall do is declaring seyfert module and set the `withPrefix` property inside [`InternalOptions`](https://github.com/tiramisulabs/seyfert/blob/455ed12b0ebcb3ddf55bc8b3274b0ce904becc62/src/commands/applications/shared.ts#L11) into true. You can see this [detailed example](/getting-started/declare-module#internal-options).


In this example we are going to create a command which `cross post` the message that was sent in an announcement channel.

```ts showLineNumbers copy
import { 
    Command,
    CommandContext,
    Declare
} from 'seyfert';

@Declare({
    name: 'crosspost',
    description: 'Cross post and announcement message.'
})
export default class CrosspostCommand extends Command {
    async run(ctx: CommandContext){
        if(ctx.message) await ctx.message.crosspost();
        return ctx.write({ content: 'I have cross posted your announcement.'});
    }
};
```

:::note
Currently, there isn't any support for applications which use both `prefix commands` and `application commands` for selecting which commands are from a specific type. All the commands are consider as application commands and prefix commands.

:::note
Seyfert supports subcommands within prefix commands.

## Replying to prefix commands

By default when you use `write` or `editOrReply` function it will only send a message to the channel where the command was fired. To make the command being replied you have to set `reply` suboption inside `command` option in the client options. This option is a callback which first parameter is the [`CommandContext`](https://github.com/tiramisulabs/seyfert/blob/455ed12b0ebcb3ddf55bc8b3274b0ce904becc62/src/commands/applications/chatcontext.ts#L24) and expects a boolean to be returned, if is `true` it will reply to the command, if not it will just send a message.

Here is a detailed example about how it will looks your client with all the modifications mentioned in this guide:

```ts showLineNumbers copy ins={9} wrap

import { Client } from 'seyfert';

const client = new Client({
    commands: {
        prefix: (msg) => {
            //here you can handle whichever prefixes you will want to be consider depending on the message data.
            return ['!', '?', '.']
        },
        reply: (ctx) => true
    }
});

```

## Prefix commands options

Like `application commands` you can set options for `prefix commands`. The only think you will have to do it's to declare them as you do in `application commands`. They are parsed with a regex that indicates options will be splited when they are followed by `-`. You can replace the parser with your own parser in the `argsParser` suboption inside `commands` options in client options. This is a callback whose params are `content`, the content of the message, and `command`, the command which was run and expects an object whose keys are the options and values the values of the options.

Here is a brief template which shows how options work in prefix commands.

```txt hideLineNumbers title="Prefix Command Template"
!command -option option_value -option2 option2_value
```


Here you can see how we make the previous command but instead of cross posting the current command cross posing another message, fetching it by its id that will be given to us in the options.

```ts showLineNumbers copy
import { 
    Command,
    CommandContext,
    Declare,
    Options,
    createStringOption
} from 'seyfert';

const options = {
    id: createStringOption({
        description: 'The id of the message we are going to cross post',
        required: true
    })
};

@Declare({
    name: 'crosspost',
    description: 'Cross post and announcement message.'
})
@Options(options)
export default class CrosspostCommand extends Command {
    async run(ctx: CommandContext<typeof options>){
        await ctx.client.messages.crosspost(ctx.options.id, ctx.channelId);
        return ctx.write({ content: 'I have cross posted your announcement.'});
    }
};
```

## Defering the reply with prefix commands

As in `application commands` you can defer reply the response of the command. By default if you use `CommandContext.deferReply()` function it will make the response to be deferred showing a `Loading ...` message. If we want it to be custom we will have to take another look into `commands` option in client options as we have to create a callback for `deferReplyResponse` which expects the content you will send in the defer to be returned.

Here is an example of how we modify the client options and how we make the response of the command to be deferred using the previous example.


<Tabs>
<TabItem label='index.ts'>

```ts showLineNumbers copy ins={10} wrap

import { Client } from 'seyfert';

const client = new Client({
    commands: {
        prefix: (msg) => {
            //here you can handle whichever prefixes you will want to be consider depending on the message data.
            return ['!', '?', '.']
        },
        reply: (ctx) => true,
        deferReplyResponse: (ctx) => ({ content: 'Thinking...' }) 
    }
});
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem label='command.ts'>

```ts showLineNumbers copy ins={23, 27}
import { 
    Command,
    CommandContext,
    Declare,
    Options,
    createStringOption
} from 'seyfert';

const options = {
    id: createStringOption({
        description: 'The id of the message we are going to cross post',
        required: true
    })
};

@Declare({
    name: 'crosspost',
    description: 'Cross post and announcement message.'
})
@Options(options)
export default class CrosspostCommand extends Command {
    async run(ctx: CommandContext<typeof options>){
        await ctx.deferReply();
        await ctx.client.messages.crosspost(ctx.options.id, ctx.channelId);
        return ctx.editOrReply({ content: 'I have cross posted your announcement.'});
    }
};
```
