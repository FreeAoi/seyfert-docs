## Creating a Sub Commands

In order to create Sub Commands you need to create a `parent` class command and then create the sub commands as classes that extends `SubCommand` and finally you need to add the sub commands to the parent command using the `@Options` decorator.

:::note

Why we need to add the sub commands to the parent command using the `@Options` decorator?

Well, the answer in simple words is because discord treats sub commands as options of the parent command. And following that way in seyfert you pass the sub commands as options to the parent command.

:::



Let's check an example. Suppose you have the following directory structure:

<FileTree>
- src
 - commands
	- account
	 	- **create.command.ts**
	 	- **delete.command.ts**
	 	- **parent.ts**
 - index.ts
- seyfert.config.js
- package.json
- tsconfig.json
</FileTree>

<Tabs>
	<TabItem label='parent.ts' icon="seti:typescript">

:::tip

With this file structure you can use `@Autoload()` and seyfert will add the commands for you so you don't add them manually in the `@Options` decorator.
But make sure you export by default the sub-commands.

:::


	```ts copy
import { Declare, Command, Options } from "seyfert";
import { CreateCommand } from "./create.command";
import { DeleteCommand } from "./delete.command";

@Declare({
		name: "account",
		description: "account command"
})
// Being in the same folder with @AutoLoad() you can save this
@Options([CreateCommand, DeleteCommand])
export class AccountCommand extends Command {}

```
	</TabItem>
	<TabItem label='create.command.ts' icon="seti:typescript">
	
```ts copy
import { type CommandContext, Declare, SubCommand } from "seyfert";

@Declare({
	name: "create",
	description: "create a new something"
})
export class CreateCommand extends SubCommand {
	run(ctx: CommandContext) {
		// some logic there

		return ctx.write({
			content: "create command executed"
		});
	}
}
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem label='delete.command.ts' icon="seti:typescript">
```ts copy
import { type CommandContext, Declare, SubCommand } from "seyfert";

@Declare({
	name: "delete",
	description: "delete something"
})
export default class DeleteCommand extends SubCommand {
	run(ctx: CommandContext) {
		// some logic here

		return ctx.write({
			content: "delete command executed"
		});
	}
}
```
	</TabItem>
</Tabs>
