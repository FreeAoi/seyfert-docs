Message components are components attached in messsages which the user could interact with them. Those components are: [`Buttons`](/api/classes/button), [`SelectMenus`](/api/classes/selectmenu) and [`TextInputs`](/api/classes/textinput).

In this guide we are going to cover:

* Creation of each type of component.

* Handling their interactions in a static way.

* Using collectors.

We are also being covering [`Modals`](/api/classes/modal). Althrough they aren't components at all, as they aren't attached within a message, they could be handled as the other ones in the same way.
